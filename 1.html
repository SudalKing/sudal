  <p>Python is an interpreted high-level <strong>general-purpose <u>programming language</u>.</strong>
  Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
  Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
  logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:45px;">Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
  It supports multiple programming paradigms,
  including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
  Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>
  <p>Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s,
  as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.</p>
  <p>Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting.
  Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and
  much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.</p>
