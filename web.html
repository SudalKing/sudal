  60% of the world is online and we want and need to reflect the diversity of the whole world as more people continue to access,
  use and create the web.
  We believe that more diversity means better representation,
  which leads to better and more inclusive design.
  Indeed, more background, more use cases, more edge cases, lead to a better Web.
  More diversity also brings higher quality results.
